For the main.py : the code is working perfectly but it needs some cleaning like creating sperate functions for each process to make it clearer.
the segmentation part is working fine on selected images but we are trying to improve the algorithm to read all characters from random words .



For the neural network : the model is made and ready but we are working on the prediction part to make it work with our inputs from the main part.
